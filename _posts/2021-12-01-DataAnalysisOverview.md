# What is data Anaysis
> Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions and supporting decision-making

# Types
1. Data Mining
2. Business Intelligence
3. Statistical Analysis
4. Predictive Analytics
5. Text Analytics


1. Data Mining
   - its a technique to inspect large data set for extracting pattern,info from it
   - we uses AI and ML technique for it
   - goal is extracting meaning from data not data

2. Business Intelligence
   - acquire and transform large amount of unstructure data
   - analyse it and discover useful information.

3. Statistical analysis
   - study the lots of data
   - analyse , interpret, present and organize the data
   - descriptive Statistics
     - describe numerical data
     - mean, standard deviation for continous data
     - frequency and percentage for descrete data
   - Inferential Statistics
     - inference mean conclusion reached on basis of evidence
     - it uses pattern in data to draw conclusion
     - Hypothesis testing(answering yes/no about the data)
     - Estimation (Estimating numerical chracterstics of data)
     - Corelation (describe association with in the data)
     - regression analysis( Modeling relationship among the data)

4. Predictive Analysis
   - focasting the future by analysing the past behaviour

5. Text Analysis
   - Drawing information from textual data

# Data Analysis Process
1. Data Requirements Specification
   - Identify the necessary variable needed for decision making
2. Data Collection
   - Ensure correct and honest data gathred
   - data gathred from  various sources like databases, IOT devices, webpages, Excel, XML.
   - Unwanted or no information can be gathred
3. Data Processing
   - Structuring the gathred data
   - Normalized structure, or dimensional structure, or table structure can be included.
4. Data Cleaning
   - data can be incompleted, missed.
   - it can be duplicated, some rules may be present and as per rule it can be incorrect.
   - wrong info, outlier can be present
5. Data Analysis
   - Exploratory data analysis using statistical tool can be done.
6. Communication
   - data is presented in graph and charts
